## Overview
An investor is seeking specific insight about temperature trends before opening a surf shop in Oahu, Hawaii. Specifically, he wants temperature data for the months of June and December, in order to determine if a surf and ice cream shop will be sustainable year-round.

## Results

### June

#### - 30 days in the month of June, with 1700 datapoints "counts", equates to approximately 8 years of data

### December

 #### - 31 days in the month of December, with 1517 datapoints "counts", equates to approximately 7 years of data

- There was an average temperature of 75 degrees in June over an 8 years period, and an average temperature of 71 degrees in December; which is a standard deviation of 4 degrees.
- The minimum temperature for both months is less than 65 degrees (64 and 56).

## Summary
The minimum temperature would be something to consider (June 64 and Dec 56 degrees) regarding establishing a business that has a template for staying cool -ice-cream and water sports. Another area of prospective is the average temperature, 74 in June and 71 in December, the standard deviation (std) or range from the average is less than 4 (degrees) for both, provided through the statistical analysis; this is concise enough to build upon through research & development to expand other services or products to provide to consumers and explanations for lulls or loss of revenue.

I would recommend two additional queries, for August and maybe January or February, as these are considered closer to the opposite ends of the temperature spectrums. With reference to precipitation, it would be a good idea to query the same range of dates to have for analysis as well.
